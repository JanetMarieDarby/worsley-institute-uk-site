<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We must strive to see people not only as they present themselves in illness, but more importantly as they would be in perfect health and balance, in full discovery of their true nature, unique in body, mind and spirit.</p>
<p>— <cite> Professor J.R. Worsley</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/pages/j-r-worsley">J.R. was a devoted Master</a> and teacher of Five-Element Acupuncture. Together with <a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/pages/judy-worsley">Judy Becker Worsley</a>, he founded the Worsley Institute in order to protect the purity of the lineage that had been bestowed on him by his teachers in Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea.</p>
<p>It was J.R.’s wish that the lineage, which he also referred to as “A Way of Life”, was continued without corruption or deviation; he held fast to that dedication and training and inspired hundreds of students around the world for nearly 50 years from 1956 until his death in 2003.</p>
<p>In a world where many are searching for meaning and connection, the Worsley Institute continues this dedication to the preservation and promotion of this system of medicine which has its roots in Natural Law. This new training course in the UK has been designed to convey and nurture the importance of our relationship with Nature, Self, and Spirit.
If you are looking for an acupuncture training where you enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>spending time in nature</li>
<li>watching and listening to the world around you</li>
<li>knowing yourself and others through the Laws of Nature</li>
<li>honing your senses</li>
<li>helping others</li>
<li>appreciating the simpler things in life</li>
<li>working with people on a profound level</li>
</ul>
<p>then we firmly believe that this course is for you.</p>

Worsley’s teachings, post-graduate support, mentoring and master-apprentice-style training, originally set up by J.R. and Judy Worsley, and now hosted by Judy Worsley and the Worsley Institute.</p>
<p>We are not expecting extensive essays on the history and theory of acupuncture, or lots of online reading and research. Instead, the faculty team guided by Judy Worsley will be offering inspirational, high quality, and thought-provoking, relatable training.</p>
