        J.R. was a devoted Master and teacher of Five-Element Acupuncture.
        Together with Judy Becker Worsley, he founded the Worsley Institute in
        order to protect the purity of the lineage that had been bestowed on him
        by his teachers in Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea.
    </p><p>
        It was J.R.’s wish that the lineage, which he also referred to as “A Way
        of Life”, was continued without corruption or deviation; he held fast to
        that dedication and training and inspired hundreds of students around
        the world for nearly 50 years from 1956 until his death in 2003.
    </p><p>
        In a world where many are searching for meaning and connection, the
        Worsley Institute continues this dedication to the preservation and
        promotion of this system of medicine which has its roots in Natural Law.
        This new training course in the UK has been designed to convey and
        nurture the importance of our relationship with Nature, Self, and
        Spirit.
    </p><p>If you are looking for an acupuncture training where you enjoy:</p><ul>
        <li>spending time in nature</li>
        <li>watching and listening to the world around you</li>
        <li>knowing yourself and others through the Laws of Nature</li>
        <li>honing your senses</li>
        <li>helping others</li>
        <li>appreciating the simpler things in life</li>
        <li>working with people on a profound level</li>
