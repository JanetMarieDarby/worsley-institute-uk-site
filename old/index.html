                            <h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>J.R. was a devoted Master and teacher of Five-Element Acupuncture. Together with Judy Becker Worsley, he founded the Worsley Institute in order to protect the purity of the lineage that had been bestowed on him by his teachers in Taiwan, Singapore, and Korea.</p>
<p>It was J.R.’s wish that the lineage, which he also referred to as “A Way of Life”, was continued without corruption or deviation; he held fast to that dedication and training and inspired hundreds of students around the world for nearly 50 years from 1956 until his death in 2003.</p>
<p>In a world where many are searching for meaning and connection, the Worsley Institute continues this dedication to the preservation and promotion of this system of medicine which has its roots in Natural Law. This new training course in the UK has been designed to convey and nurture the importance of our relationship with Nature, Self, and Spirit.</p>
<p>If you are looking for an acupuncture training where you enjoy:</p>
<ul>
<li>spending time in nature</li>
<li>watching and listening to the world around you</li>
<li>knowing yourself and others through the Laws of Nature</li>
<li>honing your senses</li>
<li>helping others</li>
<li>appreciating the simpler things in life</li>
<li>working with people on a profound level</li>
</ul>
<p>then we firmly believe that this course is for you.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/JBW-Open-Winc-Letter.pdf">Open Letter from Judy Worsley</a>, highlighting the transmission of the lineage of Classical Five-Element Acupuncture to hundreds of acupuncturists the world over through J.R. Worsley’s teachings, post graduate support, mentoring and master-apprentice-style training, originally set up by J.R. and Judy Worsley, and now hosted by Judy Worsley and the Worsley Institute.</p>
<p><a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIT-UK-Programme-Structure.pdf">The Programme Structure</a>. We are not expecting extensive essays on history and theory of acupuncture, or lots of online reading and research. Instead, Judy Worsley, Janet Darby, Louise Webster, and the faculty team will be offering inspirational, high quality, and thought-provoking, relatable training.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://worsleyinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/WIT-UK-Faculty-List.pdf">full faculty team</a>, a team dedicated to recapture J.R.’s original inspirational, meaningful, face-to-face class training in the oral tradition, staying true to the on-going Worsley lineage.</p>
<p>We are delivering the training in Judy and JR Worsley’s home. Depending on the geographical location of the participants we may vary the location from time to time in order to make it more affordable or more practical for attendees. This beautiful rural setting allows us to fully immerse ourselves in nature, and to have a retreat-type training experience whilst still being a stone’s throw from local shops, accommodation and facilities.</p>
<h2 id="wit-uk-are-committed-to">WIT UK are committed to:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Minimizing academic and financial pressures</li>
<li>Offering a training that is engaging, stimulating and fun</li>
<li>Being inspired by JR’s style, content and approach, which includes enjoying being together with a common mission.</li>
</ul>
